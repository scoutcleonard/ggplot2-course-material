# Exercise 1

-   Explore the TfL bike share data visually:\
    **create a timeseries of reported bike shares on weekend days**
    -   Highlight day and night encoded by colors and shapes.
    -   Connect the points of each period with lines.
        -   What is the difference between `geom_line()` and `geom_path()`?
    -   Apply your favorite theme to the plot.
    -   Add meaningful labels.
-   Save the plot as a vector graphic with a decent plot size.

## Data import

```{r}
#| label: preparation
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

bikes <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/graphic-design-ggplot2/main/data/london-bikes-custom.csv", 
  col_types = "Dcfffilllddddc"
)

bikes$season <- fct_inorder(bikes$season)

bikes
```

## Timeseries of reported bike shares on weekend days

```{r}
#| label: plot

weekend_bike_shares <- bikes %>% 
  filter(is_weekend == "TRUE")

ggplot(data = weekend_bike_shares, aes(x = date, y = count, colo)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = day_night,
                 shape = day_night)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = day_night),
            color = "grey") +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Lora",
                base_size = 10) +
  labs(title = "Weekend Bikes Shares by Time of Day",
       subtitle = "2015-2016",
       x = "Weekend Date (Year - Month)",
       y = "Number of Reported Bike Shares",
       color = "Part of Day",
       shape = "Part of Day") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = "bottom")
  
ggsave(here("exercises", "plots", "02_concepts_pt1_ex1.png"),
       width = 9, height = 5, bg = "white")
