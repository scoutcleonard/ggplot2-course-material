# Exercise 2

-   Explore the TfL bike sharing data visually:\
    **create a boxplot of counts per weather type**
    -   Turn the plot into a jitter strips plot (random noise across the x axis)
    -   Combine both chart types (jittered points on top of the boxplots)
    -   [Bonus: sort the boxplot-jitter hybrid by median counts]{style="color:#5DB699;"}
    -   Apply your favorite theme to the plot.
    -   Add meaningful labels.
    -   [Bonus: Explore other chart types to visualize the distributions.]{style="color:#5DB699;"}
-   Save the plot as a vector graphic with a decent plot size.

## Data import

```{r}
#| label: preparation
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

bikes <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/graphic-design-ggplot2/main/data/london-bikes-custom.csv", 
  col_types = "Dcfffilllddddc"
)

bikes$season <- fct_inorder(bikes$season)

bikes
```

## Boxplot of counts per weather type

```{r}
#| label: plot

ggplot(data = bikes, aes(x = reorder(str_wrap(weather_type, 6),
                                     count),
                         y = count)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Roboto Condensed") +
  labs(title = "Reported Bike Shares By Weather Type",
       x = "Weather Type",
       y = "Number of Reported Bike Shares")

ggsave(here("exercises", "plots", "02_concepts_pt1_ex2.png"),
